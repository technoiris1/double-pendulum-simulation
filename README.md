hi! this is my attempt at making a double pendulum simulation based off euler-lagrangian equations. it has different features like -

1) its interactive - you can tweak parameters like mass of the bobs, length of the rods and the g (acceleration due to gravity).
2) you can add a wind drag - you can add a wind of upto 100 km/h speed from either of four directions - top, bottom, left or right - and the model will show the deflection caused by it.
3) there are line graphs for different readings - first one is an acceleration vs time graph, second is an angular velocity vs time graph and third is am energy graph plotting kinetic, potential and total energy - also proving law of conservation of energy in real time.
